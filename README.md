# Simple Ordering System for Restaurants

## 1. Introduction

This desktop application is for restaurant waiters /
waitresses to manage meal orders. Users can edit and view
the menu, add dishes to cart, place an order, edit an order,
and check out. This application is faced to restaurant 
waiters / waitresses.

I am interested in this project because an automatic
food ordering system is a lot more convenient than the 
traditional pen and paper way of ordering. It offers 
a way to easily track and manage orders. I hope this simple 
application can help restaurants in my hometown.
