# Simple Ordering System for Restaurants

## 1. Introduction

This desktop application is for restaurant waiters /
waitresses to manage meal orders. Users can edit and view
the menu, add dishes to cart, place an order, edit an order,
and check out. This applicatio
n is faced to restaurant 
waiters / waitresses.

I am interested in this project because an automatic
food ordering system is a lot more convenient than the 
traditional pen and paper way of ordering. It offers 
a way to easily track and manage orders. I hope this simple 
application can help restaurants in my hometown.
